FlexiList is a custom data structure designed to handle different data types, providing a versatile and flexible solution for storing and manipulating diverse data elements. It is implemented as a singly linked list, offering efficient insertion, retrieval, and modification operations.

Key Features
1)Support for Multiple Data Types: FlexiList accommodates integers, strings, and characters, enabling the storage and manipulation of various data types within a single data structure. This versatility allows you to handle different data types seamlessly.

2)Dynamic Addition: The add() method allows for the seamless addition of elements to the end of the list, ensuring the flexibility to expand the data structure as needed. Adding elements dynamically allows you to adapt the list to changing requirements without any constraints on its size.

3)Efficient Operations: FlexiList offers addFirst() methods to efficiently add elements at the beginning of the list, maintaining optimal performance even with large datasets. This ensures that you can efficiently prepend elements to the list when necessary.

4)Data Retrieval: The getDataAt(), getStrAt(), and getCharAt() methods enable the retrieval of specific elements at given indices, facilitating easy access to stored data. You can retrieve elements by their index, allowing you to access and work with specific data points in the list.

5)Modifying Elements: The updateAtIndex() method allows for updating integer, string, or character elements at specific indices, ensuring flexibility in modifying stored data. This feature allows you to modify existing elements in the list according to your needs.

6)Removal of Elements: The remove() method enables the removal of elements at specified indices, providing the ability to manage and maintain the desired data structure. Removing elements allows you to control the contents of the list and remove unnecessary or unwanted data points.


Getting Started
To use FlexiList in your project, follow these steps:
